# HydroponiKs
**My first Python GUI project** <br/>
OSU Engineering 1182 Design Project to produce a prototype for a project after doing market research, determining user needs, and evaluating how our idea meets those requirements. <br />

**HydroponiKs**: GUI to connect with a hydroponics prototype system. <br/>

A GUI using Tkinter <br/>
-data/schedule is stored and easily accessible </br>
-json files contain all plant information and education modules for easy access to add or remove plants/modules <br/>
-MVC design pattern to easily change GUI view or have alternate forms of data collection <br/>
