        "text":"This project uses many different forms of STEM including coding, 3D modeling, 3D printing, hydroponics (working with plants), and working with a team. Teamwork is very important in STEM because all of these different parts have to come together, and each person has to contribute their part. This could be as simple as getting some of your friends to work together on something you want to make.",
